# Contributing to Tacit

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Development Setup

This workspace uses `pnpm`. Please use `pnpm` commands in examples and keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` as the canonical lockfile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jshreyansh/tacit.git
cd tacit
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with clear, atomic commits.
3. Run type checking before submitting:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

4. Open a Pull Request against `main`.

Do not add `package-lock.json` files back to the repo as part of routine dependency changes.

## Commit Convention

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug
docs: update documentation
refactor: restructure code without behavior change
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- 2-space indentation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Prefer inline Tailwind over CSS classes

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue at [github.com/jshreyansh/tacit/issues](https://github.com/jshreyansh/tacit/issues) with:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- OS and Node.js version
