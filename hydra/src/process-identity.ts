/**
 * Durable process-identity capture for dispatched runs.
 *
 * Why this exists: when an assignment's terminal is later found missing
 * (app restart, crash, user close), we need a way to distinguish
 *   (a) the original worker is still running — leave it alone,
 *   (b) the process died and the PID was never reused — safe to mark failed,
 *   (c) the PID got recycled to a totally unrelated process — do not kill.
 *
 * A raw PID alone cannot disambiguate (b) from (c) — Linux recycles PIDs
 * aggressively on tight process tables. shell_pid + captured_at gives the
 * reconcile logic enough to compare against the kernel's reported start
 * time of whatever currently holds that PID. This file writes the record;
 * the reconcile pass (separate commit) reads it.
 *
 * Capture is best-effort. Telemetry may be unreachable (app not running,
 * IPC flake) or the PTY may not have spawned its shell at the moment we
 * ask. Either condition leaves process_identity undefined on the run,
 * which reconcile reads as "unknown — prompt the user" rather than as
 * "definitely orphaned". Silent skip is the right default here.
