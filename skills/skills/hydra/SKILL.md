# Hydra Orchestration Toolkit

Hydra is a Lead-driven orchestration toolkit. You (the Lead agent) make strategic
decisions; Hydra handles operational management (dispatch, retry, health checks,
result collection).

Sub-agents output semantic intent (`done`/`needs_rework`/`replan`), not routing
information. Hydra manages the lifecycle; you decide what happens next.

## Why this design (vs. other coding-agent products)

- **SWF decider pattern, specialized for LLM deciders.** Hydra is the AWS SWF / Cadence / Temporal decider pattern. `hydra watch` is `PollForDecisionTask`; the Lead is the decider; `lead_terminal_id` enforces single-decider semantics.
- **Parallel-first, not bolted on.** `dispatch` + `depends_on` + worktree + `merge` are first-class. Other products (Factory.ai's Droid, Amp, Claude Code subagents) treat parallelism as open research; Hydra makes it the default.
- **Typed result contract.** Workers publish a schema-validated `result.json` (`outcome: completed | stuck | error`, optional `stuck_reason: needs_clarification | needs_credentials | needs_context | blocked_technical`). Other products return free-text final messages and require downstream parsing.
- **Lead intervention points.** `hydra reset --feedback` lets the Lead actually intervene at decision points instead of being block-and-join. A stale or wrong run is one `reset` away.

## Lead operational rules

Core rules:
- **Root cause first.** Fix the real implementation problem before changing tests, fixtures, or mocks.
- **Do not hack tests** to force a green result. If a test is wrong, fix it honestly.
- **No silent fallbacks** or swallowed errors. Surface failure with `outcome=stuck` or `outcome=error`.

Agent launch rule:
- When dispatching Claude/Codex through Tacit, start a fresh agent terminal with `tacit terminal create --prompt "..."`.
- Do not use `tacit terminal input` for task dispatch — it is not a supported automation path.

Telemetry polling:
- Treat `hydra watch` as the main polling loop. Do not infer progress from terminal prose.
- Before deciding wait / retry / takeover, query:
  - `tacit telemetry get --workflow <workflowId> --repo .`
  - `tacit telemetry get --terminal <terminalId>`
  - `tacit telemetry events --terminal <terminalId> --limit 20`
- Watch the derived telemetry states: `awaiting_contract` means the worker has not yet published `result.json`; `stall_candidate` means the worker may be hung. Trust `derived_status` and `task_status` over terminal prose.

## Core workflow

The Lead is the decider — Lead reads the codebase, makes the strategic
calls, and dispatches workers for the steps that genuinely need a fresh
agent process. There is no "researcher" role: the Lead does the research
itself before deciding what to build.

```
hydra init --intent "Add OAuth login" --repo .
# → { workflow_id, worktree_path }

# (Lead reads the code, reviews related modules, decides the plan.)

hydra dispatch --workflow W --node dev --role dev \
  --intent "Implement OAuth middleware and its tests following the design in CLAUDE.md" --repo .
# → { node_id, assignment_id, status: "dispatched" }

hydra watch --workflow W --repo .
# → DecisionPoint: dev completed

hydra dispatch --workflow W --node review --role reviewer \
  --intent "Independent review of the OAuth change" \
  --depends-on dev --repo .

hydra watch --workflow W --repo .
# → DecisionPoint: review completed

hydra complete --workflow W --repo .
```

## Parallel dev

When the Lead identifies independent work streams, dispatch multiple
dev workers with isolated worktrees:

```
hydra dispatch --workflow W --node dev-frontend --role dev \
  --intent "Frontend OAuth components and their tests" \
  --worktree .worktrees/frontend --repo .

hydra dispatch --workflow W --node dev-backend --role dev \
  --intent "Backend OAuth middleware and its tests" \
  --worktree .worktrees/backend --repo .

hydra watch --workflow W --repo .
# → DecisionPoint: both completed

hydra merge --workflow W --nodes dev-frontend,dev-backend --repo .
```

## Handling agent results

When `watchUntilDecision` returns a `node_completed` DecisionPoint:

1. Check `outcome`:
   - **`completed`** — agent finished. Read `report_file` to decide next step.
   - **`stuck`** — agent can't proceed. Read `report_file` for what's needed.
   - **`error`** — Hydra already retried; if still failing, it reports to you.

2. Read the `report.md` referenced by `report_file` to decide:
   - Dispatch next node → `hydra dispatch ...`
   - Reset for rework → `hydra reset --workflow W --node dev --feedback "..." --repo .`
   - Re-dispatch after reset → `hydra redispatch --workflow W --node dev --repo .`
   - Complete workflow → `hydra complete --workflow W --repo .`

Hydra promotes blocked nodes to eligible automatically, but **you decide
when to dispatch**. Check `newly_eligible` in the DecisionPoint to see
what's ready.

## Agent role guidance

The role file (in `.hydra/roles/<name>.md` or shipped builtin) declares
an ordered `terminals[]` list of CLI / model / reasoning_effort triples.
Hydra always picks `terminals[0]` for now; future fallback logic walks
the list. The Lead chooses **which role** to dispatch — the role file
chooses **which CLI** to invoke and at what reasoning level.

**lead** — The Hydra decider itself. Not dispatched by `hydra dispatch`;
this role file codifies what the Lead terminal (the one holding the
`lead_terminal_id` lock and talking to the human) is supposed to be.
Default: Claude Opus at max reasoning.

**dev** — Writes code AND the tests that cover it. A dev-produced change
is not complete until its test surface covers the new behavior. Default:
Claude Opus at max reasoning, codex fallback.

**reviewer** — Independent cross-model second opinion at the highest
available reasoning level. Default: Codex at xhigh, Claude Opus max
fallback. Runs on a **different model family** from dev so blind spots
don't overlap. The last line of defense before Lead approves a change.

There is no `researcher` role: the Lead does the research itself
before dispatching anything. There is no separate `tester` role either:
dev owns its own test surface, and reviewer provides the cross-model
check that tester used to provide.

You can override the model or reasoning effort per-dispatch via
`--model` and a project-level role file in `.hydra/roles/`.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `hydra init` | Create workflow context |
| `hydra dispatch` | Dispatch an agent node |
| `hydra watch` | Wait for next decision point |
| `hydra approve` | Mark a node's output as approved |
| `hydra reset` | Reset a node and downstream |
| `hydra merge` | Merge parallel worktree branches |
| `hydra complete` | Mark workflow completed |
| `hydra fail` | Mark workflow failed |
| `hydra status` | Show workflow state |
| `hydra list` | List workflows |
| `hydra ledger` | Show workflow event log |
| `hydra cleanup` | Clean up workflow state |
| `hydra spawn` | Direct isolated worker (not a full workflow run) |

## After `hydra dispatch` or `hydra watch`, always watch

After dispatching nodes, always call `hydra watch` to wait for the next
decision point. Do not poll manually with tick.

## Result contract

Sub-agents write a slim `result.json` with `schema_version: "hydra/result/v0.1"`
plus a sidecar `report.md`. The JSON holds only what Hydra needs for routing;
all human-readable content lives in `report.md`.

`result.json` fields:
- `schema_version`, `workflow_id`, `assignment_id`, `run_id` — passthrough IDs
- `outcome`: `"completed"` / `"stuck"` / `"error"` — Hydra uses this for routing
- `report_file`: relative or absolute path to the `report.md` written alongside

Hydra rejects any extra fields. Write `report.md` first, then publish
`result.json` atomically as the final artifact of the run.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "hydra/result/v0.1",
  "workflow_id": "wf-...",
  "assignment_id": "asg-...",
  "run_id": "run-...",
  "outcome": "completed",
  "report_file": "report.md"
}
```

`report.md` is free-form markdown. Recommended sections: summary of what was
done, outputs (file paths + descriptions), evidence (test runs, manual checks),
and a reflection on approach / blockers / confidence.

## Ledger

Every workflow action is recorded in `.hydra/workflows/{id}/ledger.jsonl`.
Use `hydra ledger --workflow W --repo .` to inspect the event log.
