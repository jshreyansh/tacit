# Changelog

All notable changes to Tacit will be documented in this file.

## [0.39.13] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **Chrome login import completion**: host-only and `__Host-` authentication cookies retain their exact Chrome scope instead of being broadened or rejected. Re-imports remove the malformed 0.39.12 equivalent first, browser nodes are recreated against the updated identity partition, and import progress/results remain visible above the profile list.

## [0.39.12] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- **One-time Chrome session import**: Browser identities now discover local Chrome profiles and can import their signed-in website sessions into Tacit's private, persistent identity storage. Chrome remains untouched, cookie values never enter the renderer or logs, and existing browser nodes refresh after a successful import.

### Changed
- **Extension pairing is optional**: the per-tab connected-browser extension now sits behind an optional live-tab disclosure instead of being the primary browser onboarding path.

## [0.39.11] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **Connected-browser pairing no longer gets stuck on a stale code**: first-time pairing now allows 15 minutes and shows a visible countdown plus an always-available fresh-code action when a code expires or has already been used.

## [0.39.10] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Legacy Computer Use cleanup no longer removes user-managed Codex MCPs**: Codex `computer-use` MCP entries are now removed only when they contain Tacit legacy signatures, preserving custom or third-party MCP servers that use the same generic name.

## [0.39.9] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- **Tacit no longer ships its own Computer Use stack**: removed the unfinished helper, MCP server, settings page, CLI commands, launch injection, and packaging path so Codex sessions use the bundled OpenAI Computer Use plugin instead.

### Fixed
- **Legacy Computer Use MCP entries are cleaned up on skill install**: Tacit now removes stale Claude and Codex MCP registrations from older builds, including orphaned Codex TOML `args` / `env` lines that could keep pointing agents at the retired Tacit server.

## [0.39.8] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- **Unicode paths stay readable in Git-backed views**: the file tree and Git diff now parse `git ls-files` output as NUL-separated records, so Chinese and other non-ASCII filenames render as real paths instead of escaped octal strings.
- **File tree refresh prunes stale empty directories**: after tracked or ignored paths disappear, the file tree now removes empty ancestor folders that no longer exist in the refreshed path snapshot.

## [0.39.7] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Pins can render rich HTML**: pin bodies now accept full HTML documents in addition to Markdown, preserving local attachments for embedded media while keeping preview/render surfaces sandboxed.
- **Pin screenshots for visual agents**: `tacit pin render <id> --json` renders a pin's Markdown or HTML body to a stable PNG under `.tacit/pin-renders/`, so agents with image-reading capability can inspect visual pins directly from the generated file path.
- **Independent pin HTML preview window**: pin details now expose an `Open preview` / `独立预览` action that opens rich pin content in a resizable 1280×900 standalone window for human inspection.

### Changed
- **Pin render cache is cleaned during rendering**: stale render snapshots and orphaned pin render directories are pruned opportunistically when a new pin render is requested.
- **Agent pin instructions mention visual rendering**: injected pin guidance now teaches agents when to call `tacit pin render <id> --json` and how to use the returned image path.

### Fixed
- **Codex hook trust registration is documented and generated**: generated Codex hook setup now records the trusted command pattern and documents the registration behavior for future agents.

## [0.39.6] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Worktree label grid columns**: settings now let you choose how many terminal tiles are placed per row when a worktree label gathers its terminals.

### Fixed
- **Codex hooks feature flag migration**: Codex hook setup now preserves compatibility with both current and legacy feature flag names.

## [0.39.5] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Usage dashboard period views**: the usage overlay now supports richer period views with range trends, quota status, and cloud usage included alongside local usage.

### Changed
- **Usage dashboard readability**: metric labels, quota rows, trend captions, and supporting text now use stronger contrast, with more vertical spacing between cards and clearer billion-token formatting.
- **Usage dashboard layout rhythm**: the overview cards, quota panel, heatmap, and trend sections have been tightened for responsive grouping while keeping the panel easier to scan.

### Fixed
- **Codex reasoning tokens are counted correctly**: Codex usage now includes reasoning token accounting in totals and display rows.
- **Usage heatmap labels stay on one line**: active month labels no longer wrap into two lines.

## [0.39.4] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Stashed terminals can be previewed and controlled without restoring them**: hover a stashed terminal in the left panel to open a live xterm preview, inspect running output, type directly into the terminal, and select/copy text while keeping it off the canvas.

### Changed
- **macOS keeps Tacit running after the last window closes**: closing the final window now keeps the app alive in the Dock/menu bar, matching standard macOS app behavior.

### Fixed
- **Force branch deletion requires confirmation**: destructive branch deletion from the Git panel now goes through an explicit confirmation step.

## [0.39.3] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Git history graph colors are restored**: the right-panel commit graph now uses a dedicated graph palette, so topology lines, branch markers, selected nodes, and ref badges stay readable after the neutral theme update.
- **Usage dashboard visualizations are colored again**: the `Cmd+Shift+U` usage overlay now uses a dedicated usage palette for hourly bars, monthly trends, heatmaps, quotas, device rows, and insight progress instead of inheriting the neutral app accent.
- **Git history can be resized from the changes pane**: the Git panel now has a draggable split between Changes and History, matching the adjustable history panes in Cursor and VS Code while preserving a minimum visible history area.

## [0.39.2] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Left panel hierarchy is easier to scan**: the project / worktree / terminal tree uses a quieter visual hierarchy and more consistent row rhythm across sessions and history surfaces.
- **File tree keeps more context visible**: gitignored files now render dimmed instead of disappearing, and file-tree state is preserved across tab changes, panel collapse, and worktree switches.

### Fixed
- **OpenCode terminals now report real lifecycle state**: OpenCode sessions are discovered from the current database without binding stale same-directory sessions, `tool-calls` steps stay active instead of being treated as full turn completion, and the first user prompt is pushed through telemetry so left-panel titles update.
- **Pin dispatch keeps dropped pins as context**: dropped pins remain available as conversation context when dispatching work, instead of disappearing from the handoff.
- **Workspace save and external URL handling is stricter**: Electron now restricts external URL opens and workspace save paths to the intended surfaces.
- **Diagnostics logs rotate predictably**: renderer diagnostics log rotation is covered and kept within the expected behavior.
- **Terminal resize and drag-scroll hit areas are stable**: resize handles stay outside terminal content, and terminal selection drag-scroll keeps its scale guard.
- **Light theme terminal colors remain readable**: the xterm light grayscale hierarchy stays visible across CLI roles.

## [0.39.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Long-running tool calls no longer false-trigger waiting-for-input attention**: the PreToolUse fallback timers now align with Codex's stream idle timeout, so long tests, builds, and large edits stop producing premature red "awaiting input" signals.
- **Light theme terminal colors are readable again**: the xterm light palette now uses darker ANSI colors where needed, and the `OpenCode` terminal type badge now uses a theme-aware accent with sufficient contrast in both themes.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **In-terminal find (`Cmd+F`)**: Claude, Codex, and shell terminals now expose an inline find bar with next/previous navigation, case-sensitive / whole-word / regex toggles, live match counts, and focus hand-off from the terminal into the search input.

### Changed
- **Select mode no longer starts drags from text selection**: selecting text inside a terminal no longer hands off into tile dragging, and select mode no longer drags annotations. This removes an interaction conflict that made ordinary selection feel unsafe.

### Fixed
- **Headless workflow + remote CLI compatibility**: the headless workflow layer now correctly bridges the current Hydra workbench/dispatch API back onto the legacy workflow/node HTTP and CLI contract, so init / dispatch / watch / approve / reset / cleanup work again in server mode.
- **Telemetry keeps exit-state evidence**: terminal telemetry now preserves the final exit snapshot and contract status after detach, instead of dropping the useful terminal-ended state too early.
- **Dialog focus and localization regressions**: confirm dialogs now move focus inside the modal reliably, and user-facing / accessibility copy that leaked hardcoded English has been localized again.
- **Release-gate regressions**: canvas entity-anchored annotations resolve against the current project/worktree positions again, `syncWorktrees` no longer emits a synthetic update on true no-op scans, and stale release tests/docs were brought back in line with the current terminal-level canvas and Pin instruction model.

## [0.38.4] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **Pin capture guidance is now issue-like**: the injected agent instructions now tell agents to record high-density pins with Background, Observed / Request, Expected / Goal, Evidence / References, Next action, Why pinned, and Unknowns when the item is more than a lightweight memo. Thin context should be resolved by cheap local inspection or a concise user question before recording.
- **Bottom toolbar no longer shows the canvas tool picker**: removed the Move / Hand dropdown from the bottom toolbar while keeping keyboard-driven canvas navigation.

### Fixed
- **Literal `\n` leaked into pin detail views**: pin bodies now normalize agent-style escaped line breaks at the store boundary while preserving single literal newline-escape mentions.
- **Terminal cursor stayed as a grab hand in default hand mode**: the canvas still defaults to Hand, but terminal tiles opt out of the inherited pan cursor and xterm text areas keep the text-selection cursor.
- **Terminal tile window controls were hidden until hover**: minimize and close controls now stay visible while hover-only state marks still use the existing reveal behavior.

## [0.38.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Right-click menu in file tree did nothing**: every menu action (Reveal in Finder, Rename, New File, New Folder, Delete, Copy Path) opened the menu but the click never ran. The `@pierre/trees` library has a document-level `mousedown` capture handler that closes the menu when the click target isn't inside the file-tree host or a container the library recognizes. Our menu portals to `document.body` for styling reasons (Tailwind doesn't reach into the shadow DOM), so the library treated every menu click as outside-the-menu — mousedown closed it, the menu unmounted, and the button's click never fired. Fixed by wrapping the portaled menu in a div carrying `data-file-tree-context-menu-root="true"`, the marker the library's `isEventInContextMenu` check looks for.
- **Drag-from-file-tree-to-terminal**: the @pierre/trees migration left the `dragstart` listener on a `useRef`-based container that was null on the first commit (loading skeleton). The effect ran once with a null ref, bailed, and never re-attached when the tree finally mounted. Switched to a state-based ref so the effect re-runs when the container actually appears, restoring file-to-terminal drag.
- **Clicking the file tree could open files mid-drag**: opening files via the library's `onSelectionChange` meant drag-start (which auto-selects), keyboard navigation, and programmatic API calls all triggered the editor. Replaced with a dedicated click listener on the container scoped to `data-item-type="file"`.
- **"New File" / "New Folder" inside a directory created the wrong path**: the library uses canonical paths with a trailing slash for folders (`src/`), so the temp path was `src//__pierre_new_…` and downstream `fs.mkdir` / `fs.createFile` saw an invalid relative path. Strip the trailing slash before building child paths. Same fix flowed into Delete / Copy Path / Reveal so they no longer paste paths with a stray slash.
- **Rename input fought the row button for focus**: `context.close()` defaults to `restoreFocus: true`, which synchronously focuses the row button right before `startRenaming` mounts the input. Pass `{ restoreFocus: false }` for the rename and create paths.
- **Empty-area right-click had no menu**: the hand-rolled tree showed New File / Folder / Reveal / Copy Path on right-click below the rows; the library only handles row right-clicks, so the menu disappeared after the rewrite. Restored a worktree-rooted menu when contextmenu reaches the container with `defaultPrevented` still false. Skips text inputs so the search box keeps its OS clipboard menu.

### Docs
- **README hero**: swapped the single dark mock for two new screenshots — the wide multi-terminal canvas and the Hub knowledge-graph view. Same change in the Chinese README.

## [0.38.2] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Markdown sanitization**: rendered markdown (session replay, agent bubbles, etc.) now passes through DOMPurify before insertion via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Defense-in-depth against any future provider that ships HTML in message text.
- **Copy buttons in session replay**: every user prompt and assistant text row gets a muted copy icon at the bottom-right (brightens on hover, swaps to ✓ for 1.2s on success). Source is `TimelineEvent.textPreview`, capped at 16 KB by the scanner — covers the 95th-percentile message.
- **Zustand setState-loop debug middleware** (`wrapSetState`): traces high-frequency setState calls during dev so future "max update depth" regressions surface as a counter instead of a crash.

### Changed
- **Session replay footer**: removed the progress bar. The highlighted-row indicator already shows position, and the bar crowded the footer. Play/pause/seek controls stay for keyboard stepping.

### Fixed
- **Title input dragged the whole tile**: clicking-and-dragging inside the custom-title input was moving the node instead of selecting text — `onMouseDown stopPropagation` doesn't help because React Flow detects drag from `pointerdown`. The title container now carries the `nodrag` opt-out; rest of the header stays draggable.
- **Pin drawer never reopened after a transient list failure**: `pinStore.openDrawer` cached an empty array on rejection, short-circuiting every subsequent open for that project. The cache key now stays unset on failure so the next open retries.
- **One corrupt pin file aborted the whole list**: `PinStore.list()` threw on the first malformed `.md`, hiding every other pin in the repo. Per-file errors are now caught, logged, and skipped. `readFile` also validates required string fields and `ID_REGEX` before constructing a Pin.
- **Invalid pin status silently accepted on create**: `PinStore.create` skipped the status validation that `update` already had, so a CLI-created pin with a bad status would write to disk and then vanish from list/get. `create` now throws `PinStoreError 400`, matching `update`'s contract.
- **Pin dispatch errors said "Task"**: legacy "Task not found" copy and `[Task]` log prefixes leaked through `pin.dispatch.failed` toasts after the rename. Renamed to "Pin" everywhere; stale `TACIT_DIR/tasks/` comments updated to `pins/`.
- **`pnpm test` skipped the entire Pin feature**: the script still listed deleted `task-*.test.ts` files instead of the renamed `pin-*` equivalents. Replaced.
- **`wrapSetState` broke the release-build typecheck**: the wrapper's forwarded `(partial, replace)` didn't match either zustand setState overload. Single function-cast at the forwarded call; runtime semantics preserved.

### Docs
- **CLAUDE.md**: documented the Tacit Pin system — when to record a pin, the `tacit pin` CLI surface, and conventions for capturing user-deferred work.

## [0.38.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **xterm click misalignment under canvas zoom**: at any scale ≠ 100% clicks landed on the wrong cell, and at scale > 100% even a one-pixel drag selected a swathe of cells. Root cause: xterm's hit-test mixes units — `clientX − screenRect.left` is post-transform visual px while `cell.width` is pre-transform CSS layout px, so each visual pixel reads as `1/scale` of a cell. Patches `terminal._core._mouseService.getCoords` and `getMouseReportCoords` to pre-scale event coords back into CSS layout space, replacing 157 lines of window-capture event re-dispatch with a 30-line monkey-patch. Selection, drag-extend, and TUI mouse-report (vim/htop/fzf) all corrected.
- **Session replay fork icon was hover-only**: the branch-from-here affordance on assistant final answers was gated on `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`, so users couldn't tell the action existed without first hovering the row. The button is muted by default (`var(--text-muted)`) and brightens on hover via the existing color transition — the opacity gate was redundant and is removed.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-04-26

A coordinated visual + capability release. The design system grew a motion layer; every long-lived surface (settings, toolbar, side panels, agent bubble, search modal, drawer family, terminal tile chrome) was rebuilt against it. New capabilities round out the spatial-memory premise: named multi-canvas workspaces, spatial waypoints, a global command palette, drag-handoff of terminal output, snapshot history with diff, status digest, activity heatmap, and pan-to-recent-activity. Onboarding collapses to one canonical first-impression surface plus quiet contextual cues.

### Added
- **Motion system**: role-based duration / easing tokens (`--duration-instant|quick|natural|deliberate`, `--ease-out-soft|out-snap|in-soft|in-out-soft`) plus `.tc-enter-fade`, `.tc-enter-fade-up`, `.tc-enter-pop`, `.tc-enter-slide-right`, `.tc-stagger`. Honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Multi-canvas workspaces**: each canvas owns its viewport / projects / waypoints. `⌘⇧]` / `⌘⇧[` cycle, `⌘⇧N` opens management modal. Existing single-canvas state migrates forward as a "Default" canvas. Hub adds a "Canvases" section.
- **Command palette** at `⌘P`: single-file action registry with four sections (actions / terminals / projects / waypoints). Visual rhyme with SearchModal but distinct IA — sync, action-oriented.
- **Hub** (right-anchored command center, `⌘⇧J`): active terminals + recent-activity feed with sparklines + waypoints + pinned items + capability inventory. Toolbar gains a paired pressed-state trigger.
- **Spatial waypoints**: `⌘⇧1..9` save current viewport, `⌥1..9` fly back over `--duration-deliberate`. Per-project, up to 9 slots, dot-strip indicator at canvas bottom-center.
- **Snapshot history** at `⌘⇧T`: browse and restore the last 20 canvas snapshots; pre-restore captures current state so a wrong restore is itself reversible. Optional diff mode (added / removed / moved / renamed terminals between two snapshots).
- **Status digest** at `⌘⇧/`: one-keypress quiet chip listing the 3–5 most relevant terminals (just-completed, stuck, busy, focused, pinned). Click row to fly camera there.
- **Activity heatmap** at `⌘⇧A`: each tile gains a 5-minute output-volume sparkline in its header. Quiet by default, fades in via canvas-level toggle.
- **Pan-to-recent-activity** at `Alt+\``: flies to the terminal with most recent PTY output; LRU-cycles on rapid re-press.
- **Drag terminal selection → another tile or composer**: select text in any xterm, drag, drop on another tile (writes to that PTY) or composer (fills draft). Cyan-tint drop ring distinguishes from folder drop.
- **Cluster-link layer**: hairline curves between parent ↔ child agent terminals, fades in when canvas zoom < 0.6 (map mode). Hover any tile to outline its whole agent family.
- **Quiet capability cues** (`DiscoveryCue`): contextual hints registry of 8 cues with priority order (Hydra setup, pinning, search, palette, pan-to-recent, status digest, Hub, snapshot history). One chip at a time, dismiss-on-action, never reappears once acted on.
- **Drag-over canvas affordance**: 1px hairline accent inset + folder chip when an OS folder is dragged over the canvas. Empty-canvas hero responds in-place by lighting up its `⌘O` chip.
- **Composer submit feedback**: 4-state Send button (idle / ready / submitting / sent), input-halo on success, press feedback. All motion-token-driven.
- **`⌘,` settings shortcut** that toggles the modal from anywhere, including text fields.

### Changed
- **Empty canvas**: redesigned as a labeled spatial document (eyebrow + two-line `tc-hero` + drag/`⌘O` affordance), not a centered marketing popup. New `--text-hero` token + `.tc-hero` + `.tc-kbd` utility classes.
- **Settings modal**: rail-based IA (Canvas / Workflow / Ambient / Input), `tc-enter-fade-up` entrance, focus-trap, arrow-key rail navigation. Pinned to constant height across tabs.
- **Toolbar**: cut 5 buttons (Tutorial / Sessions / Usage / Refresh / Add-browser) — moved to the command palette where they belong. Left workspace name + dirty dot + theme + settings + Hub trigger. Reads as document chrome.
- **Terminal tile chrome**: paired focus ring (outer hint + border + inner reinforcement), hover/focus-visible-only action chrome, edit-title pencil affordance. Pulse-dot retimed to 1.6s.
- **AgentBubble + agent surfaces**: aligned to SessionReplayView's vocabulary — speaker via indent + alignment, not a colored eyebrow. ToolCard simplified, ThinkingBlock collapsed into a subordinate voice.
- **SearchModal** (`⌘K`) redesigned: visual rhyme with command palette, scope chips hoisted from a Tab toggle into a visible row, source-grouped results, `--scrim` backdrop.
- **Side panels** (LeftPanel / RightPanel / ProjectTree / SessionsPanel): system-wide token alignment. Five hand-coded eyebrow clones consolidated to `tc-eyebrow tc-mono`. New `tc-row-hover`, `tc-row-icon`, `tc-row-divider` utility classes.
- **Drawer family** (Pin / Stash / FileEditor / Browser / NotificationToast / UpdateModal): one shared shadow, motion, type / color register.
- **Onboarding collapsed**: WelcomePopup, DemoAnimation, welcomeStore, HydraSetupPopup deleted (−1932 LOC). HydraSetup demoted into a `DiscoveryCue` variant. Empty-canvas hero is the canonical first impression.
- **Light-theme parity**: every redesigned surface verified against `[data-theme="light"]`; introduced `--scrim` token for modal backdrops; replaced hardcoded Tailwind `amber-*` with `--amber`.
- **Hub** is fully internationalized (`useT()` + en/zh dictionaries cover every visible string, including the relative-time formatter).

### Fixed
- **Maximum update depth crash on terminal create**: a zustand v5 selector in `DiscoveryCue` returned a fresh object every call, tripping `useSyncExternalStore`'s tearing detection. Split into primitive selectors. Defensive: `terminalActivityTracker.advanceBuckets` no longer notifies listeners from the render-time read path.
- **Grey screen / hydration error**: `HistoryRow` rendered `<button>` with nested `IconButton` children (illegal HTML). Outer becomes `<div role="button">` with keyboard support, mirroring `ProjectTree`'s row pattern.
- **Terminal cursor placement under canvas zoom**: the click-correction in `TerminalTile` divided coordinates by scale on top of xterm's already-visual hit-test, introducing a per-cell offset proportional to zoom. Now only re-dispatches host/gap clicks, with raw coords.
- **Cmd+Shift+]/[ canvas-cycle silently inert**: `e.key.toLowerCase() === "]"` never matched on US/UK keyboards (Shift+] yields `}`). `matchesShortcut` now falls back to `e.code` for shifted-punctuation chords.
- **Canvas Manager Esc tore down whole manager**: pressing Esc to dismiss a delete-confirm dialog also closed the manager. Manager skips its closeManager branch when `confirmDeleteId` is set.
- **Hub Esc swallowed layered modals' dismissal**: capture-phase + stopPropagation listener stole Escape from any modal stacked above the Hub. Now bubble-phase, no stopPropagation.
- **Settings → Shortcuts missing rebind rows**: `commandPalette` / `toggleSnapshotHistory` / `toggleHub` were bound but absent from the rebind UI. Added to the Panels group with en/zh labels.
- **snapshot-history `append()` IPC path-traversal risk**: missing the regex guard already present on `read()`. Throws on non-finite / non-positive `savedAt`.
- **Settings modal jumped between tabs**: pinned to constant `h-[85vh]` so switching tabs doesn't grow/shrink the shell.
- **Dev-server reloaded on hydra dispatch**: Vite's chokidar watcher wasn't ignoring `.hydra/` and `.worktrees/` despite `.gitignore`; explicit `server.watch.ignored` now covers them.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Pin sessions**: history rows have a left-side pin affordance — pinned sessions float to a dedicated "Pinned" group at the top, persisted in localStorage.
- **Collapsible project groups**: each project in the history panel has a chevron header to collapse or expand its sessions.
- **Per-project "show more"**: groups default to 7 sessions; each click reveals one batch of 7 more, fetching from the server on demand.
- **Two-step hide**: hovering a history row shows an eye-slash button; first click arms it (red background), second click hides the session permanently with no restore path.

### Changed
- **History panel UX**: removed global "Load more" and "Show hidden" buttons. Sessions are managed per-project with independent expand/collapse controls.
- **Pin placement**: pin indicator moved to left side of session row for clearer semantics.
- **Visual alignment**: history section row density, chevron animation, font weight, and indentation now match the ProjectTree for a consistent left-panel look.
- **Timestamp hierarchy**: prompt text uses weight-medium; timestamp uses 10 px mono at `--text-muted` for clear visual separation.

### Fixed
- Port file guarded with PID check to survive crashes without leaving stale lock files.
- Removed redundant fixed-viewport dot grid overlay on the canvas.
- Show-more fetches full per-project session list from server when local cache is exhausted.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Pin sessions**: pin a session to the top of the history panel; includes a two-step hide confirmation to prevent accidental dismissal.
- **File tree**: right panel file browser replaced with `@pierre/trees` — virtualized rendering, built-in search, git status badges, and multi-select drag-to-terminal.

### Changed
- **Task → Pin**: the Task feature has been renamed to Pin throughout the codebase and UI.
- **History panel**: sharpened visual hierarchy between prompt text and timestamp; terminal status collapsed to three states (attention / active / done).
- Sessions panel redesigned with clearer status grouping.
- Close-interception dialog removed; updater install-and-restart path restored.
- Tasks are now eager-loaded on startup so badges and CLI additions are immediately visible.

### Fixed
- Space-bar pan now activates correctly in Select mode.
- Mouse interactions with the bottom toolbar no longer swallow the next Space keypress.
- Toolbar popover outside-click uses capture-phase `mousedown` to work with box-select.
- Viewport pan position snapped to integer pixels to eliminate sub-pixel jitter.
- Background grid remains stable after pan integer-snap change.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Figma-style canvas controls**: bottom-centre floating toolbar with Move/Hand tool selector, zoom in/out, zoom percentage, zoom presets (50 / 100 / 200 %), and Fit All button.
- **Hand tool**: persistent pan mode — left-drag pans instead of selecting; terminals remain focusable by clicking in Hand mode.
- **Space-bar pan**: hold Space anywhere on the canvas to temporarily activate Hand mode; release to restore the previous tool.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `V` (Move), `H` (Hand), `Shift+1` (Fit All), `Cmd/Ctrl+0` (100 %), `Cmd/Ctrl+=` (zoom in), `Cmd/Ctrl+-` (zoom out).
- Composer height awareness: bottom toolbar lifts above the composer bar as it resizes.
- Task terminal badge and drawer filter for completed tasks.
- Drag a task onto a terminal to inject its title and body as a composer prompt (without auto-submitting).

### Changed
- Default canvas tool is now **Hand** (was Move/Select).
- Move tool restricts left-drag panning to middle-button only; left-drag on empty canvas triggers marquee selection.
- Zoom controls removed from the top toolbar; they now live in the bottom floating toolbar.
- Update-ready indicator dot uses design token `--green` instead of Tailwind `green-500`.

### Fixed
- `Shift+1` (Fit All) now uses `e.code` instead of `e.key` so it works on non-US keyboard layouts.
- Cursor correctly shows `grab`/`grabbing` over terminal content in Hand mode (overrides xterm's `cursor: text !important`).
- Space-bar pan no longer intercepts button or menu-item activation.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+0/=/−` no longer intercepts keypresses inside editable fields.
- Zoom preset popover and tool popover can no longer both be open simultaneously.
- `fitAllProjects` bails early when window geometry is degenerate (tiny window or zero-size content) to prevent NaN viewport.
- Dead `isSelected` subscription removed from TerminalTile after selection ring revert.
- `useT` memoised per locale to prevent keyboard shortcut listeners from re-attaching on every render.
- `getCanvasLeftInset`, `getViewportCenterClientPoint`, and `zoomAtClientPoint` now receive `taskDrawerOpen` so zoom/fit math accounts for the Task drawer width.
- TaskDrawer participates in left-chrome layout so canvas origin is correct when the drawer is open.

### Added (zh-CN)
- **Figma 风格画布控制**：底部居中悬浮工具栏，含移动/抓手工具切换、缩放加减、缩放百分比、缩放预设（50 / 100 / 200 %）和适应全部按钮。
- **抓手工具**：持久平移模式，左键拖拽平移画布；抓手模式下仍可点击终端聚焦。
- **空格键平移**：在画布任意处按住空格键临时激活抓手模式，松开后恢复原工具。
- 快捷键：`V`（移动）、`H`（抓手）、`Shift+1`（适应全部）、`Cmd/Ctrl+0`（100 %）、`Cmd/Ctrl+=`（放大）、`Cmd/Ctrl+-`（缩小）。
- 输入框高度感知：底部工具栏随输入框高度动态上移。
- 任务终端角标与已完成任务的抽屉筛选。
- 将任务拖拽到终端可将标题和正文注入输入框（不自动提交）。

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 画布默认工具改为**抓手**（原为移动/选择）。
- 移动工具的左键拖拽平移限制为中键，左键拖拽空白区域触发框选。
- 缩放控件从顶部工具栏移至底部悬浮工具栏。

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- `Shift+1`（适应全部）改用 `e.code` 检测，兼容非 US 键盘布局。
- 抓手模式下鼠标在终端内容上正确显示 `grab`/`grabbing`。
- 空格键平移不再拦截按钮或菜单项的激活事件。
- `Cmd/Ctrl+0/=/−` 不再拦截可编辑字段内的按键。
- 缩放预设弹窗与工具弹窗不再同时打开。
- 窗口或内容尺寸退化时 `fitAllProjects` 提前退出，防止视口 NaN。
- 移除 TerminalTile 中选中环回退后残留的死订阅。
- `useT` 按 locale 缓存，防止键盘快捷键监听器在每次渲染时重挂。
- 缩放/适应计算现在传入 `taskDrawerOpen`，Task 抽屉展开时画布原点正确。

## [0.34.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Computer Use MCP overhaul**: full desktop-control toolkit with virtual cursor overlay, no-focus-steal input path, AX-first click strategy, keyboard scroll, cursor move action, foreground mouse hardening, and text input tuning.
- ScreenCaptureKit preferred for screenshots with zoom coordinate mapping and stale-coordinate rejection.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Stash button on terminal cards in the sidebar: hover any terminal to reveal a tray icon that stashes it, symmetric with the restore icon in the stash section.
- Stash section in the left sidebar with dedicated collapsible area, explicit restore/destroy buttons, and confirmation dialog for destructive actions.
- Cmd/Ctrl+Click on URLs in the terminal now opens them in the default browser.
- shadcn component system initialized (Radix + Nova) with alert-dialog, collapsible, button, and tooltip primitives.

### Changed
- Project tree always shows the branch row (removed flat-mode special case). Single-worktree projects display the branch name as a second level, matching multi-worktree layout.
- Renamed `isMain` to `isPrimary` across the worktree data model to clarify it means "primary git worktree" (directory identity), not "main branch".
- Terminal title resolution rewritten: `customTitle` stands alone (no longer concatenated with process title), `extractIntent()` extracts meaningful titles from prompts by stripping code blocks, file paths, and polite prefixes.
- Project-level [+] button now creates a worktree (terminal creation moved to each branch row's own [+]).
- Canvas edge resize handles restyle as Figma-style midpoint rectangles.

### Fixed
- ConfirmDialog redesigned: added close button, smooth hover transitions, and danger button now uses project color tokens (`var(--red)`) instead of raw Tailwind red.
- Branch row was hidden for single-worktree repos on feature branches because `isMain` (git worktree identity) was conflated with "is main branch".

### Added (zh-CN)
- 侧边栏终端卡片新增暂存按钮：hover 时显示托盘图标，可将终端暂存，与暂存区的恢复图标形成对称。
- 左侧栏新增独立暂存区，可折叠展开，包含恢复和销毁按钮，销毁前有确认弹窗。
- 终端中 Cmd/Ctrl+点击 URL 现在会在默认浏览器中打开。
- 初始化 shadcn 组件系统（Radix + Nova），包含 alert-dialog、collapsible、button、tooltip 原语。

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 项目树始终显示分支行（移除 flat 模式特例）。单 worktree 项目也会显示分支名作为第二层级。
- 将 worktree 数据模型中的 `isMain` 重命名为 `isPrimary`，明确其语义为「主 worktree」而非「main 分支」。
- 终端标题解析重写：`customTitle` 不再拼接进程标题，`extractIntent()` 通过去除代码块、文件路径和客套前缀来提取有意义的标题。
- 项目级 [+] 按钮改为创建 worktree（终端创建移至各分支行的 [+]）。
- 画布边缘缩放手柄改为 Figma 风格的中点矩形。

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- ConfirmDialog 重新设计：新增关闭按钮、平滑 hover 过渡，危险按钮改用项目色彩令牌（`var(--red)`）。
- 修复单 worktree 仓库在 feature branch 上时分支行被隐藏的问题。

## [0.32.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- macOS release builds now use ad hoc signing instead of skipping code signing entirely. This keeps the bundle identity as `com.blueberrycongee.tacit` and produces a `codesign --verify`-valid app, which avoids the unstable Screen Recording and Accessibility permission behavior seen in unsigned builds.

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- macOS release build 现在使用 ad hoc 签名,不再完全跳过代码签名。这样 bundle identity 会保持为 `com.blueberrycongee.tacit`,并产出可通过 `codesign --verify` 的 app,避免未签名构建下录屏和辅助功能权限不稳定的问题。

## [0.32.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Dragging a worktree label to compact its terminals now lays them out horizontally first instead of collapsing into a tall vertical stack.
- Hydra standalone workers now get a short natural-exit grace period after writing `result.json`, so stdout telemetry can flush the `session_id` before cleanup and `hydra ask` can resume the session reliably.
- Usage cost estimates now explicitly include GPT-5.5 and Claude Opus 4.7 pricing.

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 拖动 worktree label 来 compact terminals 时,现在会优先横向排列,不再容易收成很高的竖向栈。
- Hydra standalone worker 写出 `result.json` 后,现在会短暂等待进程自然退出,让 stdout telemetry 有机会 flush `session_id`;清理后 `hydra ask` 也能稳定续接 session。
- Usage 成本估算现在显式支持 GPT-5.5 和 Claude Opus 4.7 价格。

## [0.32.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Usage now includes Kimi and WUU sessions: Kimi `wire.jsonl` `StatusUpdate.token_usage` events and WUU `meta` `token_usage` records are scanned into daily summaries, heatmaps, cache-rate rows, and model breakdowns.
- Clicking a worktree label, either on the canvas or in a terminal header, now enters that worktree's overview mode so double-clicking a terminal zooms into it, matching the `⌘E` overview flow.

### Fixed
- Kimi and WUU usage cost estimates now use the Moonshot API-aligned rates instead of the initial rough defaults.
- Kimi/WUU heatmap parsing now returns the wrapper records correctly, so their token usage contributes to heatmap totals.
- The Settings general tab keeps the app version row pinned to the bottom instead of drifting into the main settings content.

### Added (zh-CN)
- Usage 现在会统计 Kimi 和 WUU session:Kimi 的 `wire.jsonl` `StatusUpdate.token_usage` 事件、WUU 的 `meta` `token_usage` 记录会进入每日汇总、热力图、缓存率行和模型拆分。
- 点击画布上的 worktree label 或 terminal header 里的 worktree label,现在会进入该 worktree 的 overview mode;随后双击任一 terminal 会 zoom in,行为与 `⌘E` overview 流程一致。

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- Kimi 和 WUU 的 usage 成本估算现在使用对齐 Moonshot API 的价格,不再使用最初的粗略默认值。
- Kimi/WUU 的 heatmap 解析现在会正确返回 wrapper records,它们的 token usage 会计入热力图总量。
- Settings 的 General tab 会把 app version 行固定在底部,不再漂到主要设置内容里。

## [0.31.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Left panel history and `⌘K` session search appeared completely empty on 0.31.0 even when local session files existed, and replay could not resolve a session for any terminal. The Kimi CLI integration added in 0.31.0 called `findKimiSessionFiles()` inside `electron/session-search-index.ts#listSessionFileCandidates` without importing it, so every call to `listSessionsForProjects` / `listSessionsForProjectsPaged` threw a `ReferenceError`. The main-process IPC handlers had bare `catch {}` blocks that silently returned `{ entries: [], total: 0 }`, making the regression look like "no sessions exist" instead of an error. Import restored; both IPC handlers now log the error instead of swallowing it so the next regression of this shape is not invisible. Two related type errors from the same Kimi commit were also fixed in `session-scanner.ts` (undefined `wd.kaos` fallback short-circuit) and `session-watcher.ts` (unnarrowed `call.function.name` access)

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 0.31.0 下即使本地有完整 session 文件,左侧历史面板和 `⌘K` session 搜索也完全空白,任何 terminal 都无法 replay。原因是 0.31.0 引入的 Kimi CLI 集成在 `electron/session-search-index.ts#listSessionFileCandidates` 里调用了 `findKimiSessionFiles()` 却没 import,每次 `listSessionsForProjects` / `listSessionsForProjectsPaged` 都会抛 `ReferenceError`;而主进程 IPC handler 用了裸 `catch {}` 静默返回 `{ entries: [], total: 0 }`,把这个回归伪装成"本地没有 session"。补上 import,并把两处 `catch {}` 换成带 `console.error` 的版本——这个形状的回归下次不会再隐身。顺带修掉同一次 Kimi 提交留下的两处类型错误:`session-scanner.ts` 里引用了不存在的 `wd.kaos` 字段导致条件永远走不到,`session-watcher.ts` 读 `call.function.name` 没做收窄

## [0.31.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `feat(session): add Kimi CLI support across session pipeline` — 为 Kimi CLI 添加跨 session 管线的支持

### Fixed
- `fix(session): use findKimi instead of getKimiLatest for Kimi session attachment` — Kimi session 附件改用 findKimi 而非 getKimiLatest
- `fix(renderer): 修复 WebGL 终端乱码问题` — 修复 WebGL 终端乱码问题
- `fix(ci): run postinstall bins via shell on windows` — Windows 上通过 shell 运行 postinstall 脚本
- `fix(session): remove weak fallback in findBestCodexSession` — 移除 findBestCodexSession 的 weak fallback，当 cwd 匹配失败时返回 null 而非绑定到全局最新 session

### Added (zh-CN)
- 为 Kimi CLI 添加跨 session 管线的支持

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- Kimi session 附件改用 findKimi 而非 getKimiLatest
- 修复 WebGL 终端乱码问题
- Windows 上通过 shell 运行 postinstall 脚本
- 移除 findBestCodexSession 的 weak fallback，当 cwd 匹配失败时返回 null 而非绑定到全局最新 session

## [0.30.7] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Live session rows in the left panel no longer keep a stale session identity after a terminal detaches from its session or switches to a new one. Detach now clears the terminal's session-backed telemetry state (`session_id`, `session_file`, first-user-prompt, turn/tool fields), and renderer-side telemetry diffing now treats session identity fields as meaningful changes, so a pushed snapshot from a new session cannot be collapsed as "unchanged" and leave the old session title stuck on the tile

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 左侧 live session 列表不再在 terminal 与 session 解绑或切到新 session 后继续挂着旧会话身份。现在 detach 会真正清空 terminal 上由 session 驱动的 telemetry 状态(`session_id`、`session_file`、首条用户 prompt、turn/tool 字段),同时 renderer 侧的 telemetry diff 也把这些 session identity 字段视为有效变化,所以新 session 推过来的 snapshot 不会再被当成"没变"吞掉,旧会话标题也不会继续黏在 tile 上

## [0.30.6] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Terminal glyph corruption during `⌘E` overview transitions and `⌘[` / `⌘]` focus cycling is now significantly reduced. Two lifecycle changes landed together: scene-internal terminals no longer get parked just because they temporarily fall outside the viewport during a camera animation, and when a viewport animation settles the app now runs one recovery pass across every attached live WebGL terminal instead of only the source / target tile. This removes the most disruptive remount churn from the transition path and closes a gap where non-focused live terminals could still keep a stale WebGL atlas after the animation finished

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- `⌘E` overview 切换和 `⌘[` / `⌘]` 终端切换过程里的字形损坏现象现在明显减少。这次一起改了两条生命周期策略:只要 terminal 还在 scene 里,就不会因为 viewport 动画期间短暂移出可视区域而被 park;同时 viewport 动画结束后,不再只修 source / target terminal,而是会对所有已 attach 的 live WebGL terminal 统一跑一轮 recovery。这样既去掉了过渡路径里最扰人的 remount 抖动,也补上了"非聚焦但仍然 live 的 terminal 在动画结束后 atlas 仍然陈旧"这条缺口

## [0.30.5] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- Windows 11: resuming a session could crash the whole app with an `A JavaScript error occurred in the main process` dialog reading `Error: Cannot resize a pty that has already exited`. node-pty's Windows backend queues `resize()` calls in an internal `_deferreds` list until the named-pipe socket connects; if the underlying winpty agent has already exited by the time the queue is flushed, the replayed call throws from inside a `Socket` event handler, past any try/catch at the call site (see microsoft/node-pty#375). Main process now installs a narrow `uncaughtException` handler that swallows only that exact error (and the matching `Cannot write to a pty that has already exited` variant) and rethrows everything else. Note: this stops the crash dialog — the tab whose pty already died is still dead and needs to be closed and reopened; it does not fix the underlying node-pty race

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- Win11 下续接会话时整个 app 会崩出 `A JavaScript error occurred in the main process` 弹窗,内容是 `Error: Cannot resize a pty that has already exited`。node-pty 的 Windows 后端会把 `resize()` 调用排进内部 `_deferreds` 队列,等命名管道 socket 连上之后再回放;如果此时底层 winpty agent 已经退出,回放的调用会从 `Socket` 事件回调里同步抛错,已脱离调用点的 try/catch(见 microsoft/node-pty#375)。主进程现在装了一个只针对这条错误(以及同类的 `Cannot write to a pty that has already exited`)的 `uncaughtException` handler,命中就 warn 一行吞掉,其他异常原样 rethrow。注意:这只阻止崩溃弹窗——那个已经死掉的终端 tab 还是死的,需要手动关掉重开;node-pty 本身的竞态没有修

## [0.30.4] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- Left and right side panels sometimes rendered as blank until a mouse hover repainted them — most visible after returning to the app from the background. The panels were built as two absolute-positioned surfaces swapped via opposing `opacity` transitions; Chromium could promote each into an independent compositor layer, and those layers fell out of paint sync on foreground/background switch. Replaced with conditional rendering — only the currently-active state (collapsed icon strip OR expanded surface) mounts in the DOM at any time
- Collapsing or expanding the LEFT side panel made the canvas terminals shake horizontally instead of the clean shrink/grow the right panel already produced. Three animations were running on different clocks (panel width CSS 240 ms cubic-bezier, canvas container `left` React snap with no transition, viewport `animateTo` 400 ms easeOutCubic JS). All of them now share the same 240 ms cubic-bezier curve — both the CSS string and a matching JS easing function, defined once in `src/utils/panelAnimation.ts` — so the compensating terms cancel at every frame. Terminals stay put; the middle area just widens / narrows cleanly on both sides
- Worktree labels no longer snap back to their original position after you drop them (#140)
- Updater now surfaces a toast when the app is in a location that blocks auto-update (e.g. Downloads folder, read-only volume) instead of silently skipping (#139)

### Changed
- README warns Apple Silicon users to pick the arm64 build — the x64 build runs under Rosetta 2 on M-series Macs with measurable battery / performance cost

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 左右侧栏偶尔展示成空白,只有鼠标移上去才重绘出现内容——最典型是从后台切回 app 之后。面板原本由两个 `absolute` 层用相反的 `opacity` 过渡做 crossfade,Chromium 可以把每一层提升成独立合成层,在前后台切换时这些层的重绘不一定同步。改成条件渲染:每一时刻只挂载当前状态(折叠图标条或展开面板)
- 折叠/展开**左**侧栏时画布里的终端会横向晃动一下,不像右侧栏那样干净地"缩小/放大"。原因是三条动画跑在三条不同时钟上(面板 width 走 240ms CSS cubic-bezier、画布容器 `left` 是 React 瞬跳没过渡、viewport `animateTo` 走 400ms easeOutCubic JS)。现在全部对齐到同一条 240ms cubic-bezier 曲线——CSS 字符串和 JS 缓动函数在 `src/utils/panelAnimation.ts` 里是同源定义——每帧补偿项精确抵消。终端不再晃,中间区域就是干净地从两侧变窄/变宽
- worktree 标签拖拽放下后不会弹回原位了(#140)
- 当 app 装在阻止自动更新的位置(如 Downloads 文件夹、只读卷)时,updater 现在弹 toast 提示而不是静默跳过更新(#139)

### Changed (zh-CN)
- README 提示 Apple Silicon 用户下载 arm64 版本——x64 版在 M 系 Mac 上走 Rosetta 2,耗电和性能都有可感知的差距

## [0.30.3] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- Terminals sometimes showed blank or garbled glyphs after switching back to the app from another window, waking the laptop from sleep, or on cold start. Root cause was the WebGL glyph atlas going stale without the GPU firing any signal. The fix rebuilds the atlas automatically on the four triggers that most commonly invalidate it: `window.focus` (catches Cmd+Tab back, lid-close-and-reopen, screen lock/unlock), initial tile attach after the host has laid out, theme change, and font / size / contrast change

### Added
- Toolbar "Refresh terminal rendering" button (circular-arrow icon, immediately left of the dark/light toggle). One-click rebuild of every terminal's glyph atlas — a manual escape hatch for the rare edge cases the automatic triggers can't detect (driver partial crash, GPU hot-swap, etc.). Replaces the old workaround of toggling the theme to force a redraw

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 终端偶尔会在从其他窗口切回 app、笔记本唤醒后、或冷启动时显示空白 / 错位字符。根因是 WebGL 字形 atlas 缓存在 GPU 无事件通知的情况下变质。现在在四种最常触发失效的信号上自动重建 atlas:`window.focus`(涵盖 Cmd+Tab 返回、合盖唤醒、锁屏解锁)、tile 初次 attach 后 layout 完成、主题切换、字体 / 字号 / 对比度改动

### Added (zh-CN)
- 工具栏新增"刷新终端渲染"按钮(圆形箭头图标,紧挨亮暗切换按钮左边)。一键重建所有终端的字形 atlas —— 给自动信号抓不到的罕见场景(驱动局部崩、macOS GPU 热切换等)留个手动出口。替代之前"靠切主题当 workaround"的做法

## [0.30.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- File editor drawer now renders images: PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF (animated), WebP, BMP, ICO, AVIF, APNG. Clicking an image in the Files tree or a search result previews it centered in the drawer with a transparent-checkerboard backdrop so alpha is visible. The per-file size cap is split — text stays at 512 KB, images go up to 10 MB so typical screenshots / GIFs open instead of silently failing
- Bilingual user guide at `docs/user-guide.md` + `docs/user-guide.zh.md`, linked from both READMEs. Walks through every non-obvious interaction (⌘E focus chain with double-click-to-zoom, drag-to-stash, right-click menus per surface, session resume fallback, canvas-gap drawer mutex, etc.)

### Changed
- Left and right side panels animate their expand / collapse with a 240 ms width ease and a crossfade between the narrow strip and the full surface. Nothing reflows mid-animation; the transition is suppressed while the resize handle is dragged so width still tracks the pointer 1:1
- Settings modal reorganised from 3 tabs into 5, each answering one question:
  - **General** — language, CLI integration toggle, app version + update
  - **Appearance** — font size, font family, animation, blur, minimum contrast
  - **Features** — composer, drawing tools, browser, terminal summary + its CLI picker, global search, canvas pet
  - **Agent** — API section (provider / format / base URL / key / model) + CLI Tools section (per-agent command paths)
  - **Shortcuts** — unchanged

### Fixed
- Memory tab's knowledge-graph nodes no longer shake for five seconds every time you enter the tab or a memory file is saved. The force simulation moved from the render loop (restarted on every `graph` reference change) to a one-shot offline `relaxLayout()`

### Added (zh-CN)
- 文件编辑器抽屉可以渲染图片了:PNG、JPG/JPEG、GIF(动图可播)、WebP、BMP、ICO、AVIF、APNG。在 Files 树或搜索结果里点图片,会在抽屉里居中预览,带透明棋盘底所以 alpha 能看见。单文件大小上限按类型拆分:文本保持 512 KB,图片放到 10 MB,常见截图 / GIF 不再被默默拦截
- 双语用户指南 `docs/user-guide.md` + `docs/user-guide.zh.md`,两份 README 都在顶部加了链接。把每个不说就发现不了的小交互都写清楚了(⌘E 聚焦连环 + 双击放大、拖到 stash、每类界面的右键菜单、会话续接回退、canvas-gap 抽屉互斥等等)

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 左右栏展开 / 折叠现在是 240 ms 宽度缓动 + 折叠条和完整面板之间的交叉淡入。动画中途不会 reflow;拖动 resize 把手时关闭过渡,宽度 1:1 跟着指针走
- 设置面板从 3 tab 重排成 5 tab,每个 tab 回答一件事:
  - **通用** — 语言、CLI 集成开关、app 版本 + 更新
  - **外观** — 字号、字体、动画、模糊、最小对比度
  - **功能** — composer、绘图、浏览器、终端总结 + CLI 选择器、全局搜索、水豚
  - **Agent** — API(provider / 格式 / base URL / key / model)+ CLI Tools(各 agent 命令路径)
  - **快捷键** — 保持不变

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- Memory tab 的知识图节点不再每次切进 tab 或 memory 文件保存时抖 5 秒。力场模拟从 render 循环(每次 `graph` 引用变都重跑)移到了离线一次性 `relaxLayout()`

## [0.30.1] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- Welcome demo rewritten for the v0.30 layout: shows project management + "+" in the left panel, code navigation + Monaco editor drawer on the right, session replay as a left-anchored drawer, Usage dashboard as a canvas-gap panel. Both side panels now demo their collapsed → expanded transitions on click, matching how the app actually boots
- Welcome demo Usage mock is now a dense five-row dashboard (4-card stat strip → hourly + 30-day charts → cache / projects / models bar lists → quota meters → heatmap ribbon) so it looks like the real UsageOverlay at small scale instead of a sparse placeholder
- Typography hierarchy across agent surfaces (agent chat, ChatPanel, MessageBubble, AgentStatusBar, ThinkingBlock, Hub, Diff, StatusBadges): semantic type tokens (tc-display / title / body / ui / label / eyebrow / caption, tc-mono / num) replace ad-hoc px sizes and hardcoded zinc greys so the agent subsystem no longer drifts from the rest of the app under either theme

### Fixed
- Demo: drawer animations start flush against the panel seam instead of leaving a thin grey vertical line (border-l + border-r stacking at width=0 rendered as 2-px chrome)
- Demo: cursor click positions measured from DOM refs rather than hardcoded pixels, so they land on the correct targets regardless of container width

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 欢迎 demo 对齐 v0.30 布局重做:展示左栏项目管理 + 「+」、右栏代码导航 + Monaco 编辑器抽屉、会话回放作为左锚定抽屉、Usage 仪表盘作为 canvas-gap 面板;两侧栏都按真实 app 启动状态从折叠条开始,演示被点击后展开
- Demo 里的 Usage mock 现在是密集的五行仪表盘(4 张 stat 卡 → 并排的今日小时和 30 天趋势图 → 缓存率/项目/模型三列 bar → quota 条 → 热力图),小尺寸下也能看出是真实的 UsageOverlay,而不是稀疏占位
- agent 系列界面(agent chat、ChatPanel、MessageBubble、AgentStatusBar、ThinkingBlock、Hub、Diff、StatusBadges)引入排版层级,用语义化 type token(tc-display / title / body / ui / label / eyebrow / caption、tc-mono / num)替换临时的 px 尺寸和硬编码的 zinc 灰,两种主题下 agent 子系统不再与 app 其他部分"跑调"

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- Demo:抽屉展开动画从面板接缝处贴边展开,不再留下一道灰色竖线(关闭状态 border-l + border-r 叠在一起渲染成 2px 假 chrome)
- Demo:光标点击位置改成从 DOM ref 量出,不再是硬编码 px,任何容器宽度下都能落在正确的目标上

## [0.30.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Editor: full-canvas Monaco drawer — click any file in the right panel to open it in a real VSCode-style editor with syntax highlighting, Cmd+S save, dirty tracking, and a two-level half/full width toggle. Replaces the cramped preview tab
- Editor: custom Monaco themes tuned to the app's warm palette — dark mode uses the charcoal `#1a1918` surface (not VSCode's stock cool grey); light mode gets an overhauled syntax palette (warm violet keywords, green strings, amber numbers, teal types) that reads naturally on the cream surface instead of the over-saturated stock vs colours
- Left panel: project management + session history in one place. "+" button (in the header and in the collapsed strip) adds a project in a single click; History section below ProjectTree lists past Claude/Codex sessions scoped to the current canvas
- Canvas-gap overlay system: Usage dashboard and Session replay now render as panels anchored in the gap between the left and right side panels, so both nav surfaces stay visible while you read code, dashboards, or transcripts. Three tenants (Usage / File Editor / Session Replay) are mutually exclusive in that slot

### Fixed
- Sessions: Claude Resume button is no longer grayed out — projectDir now reads the real `cwd` from inside the Claude JSONL instead of the dash-encoded directory name, so worktree matching succeeds
- Sessions: Codex Resume actually resumes the past session now — sessionId is extracted from `session_meta.payload.id` (which `codex resume` accepts) instead of the filename stem (which Codex rejected, falling back to a fresh session)
- Sessions: Resume closes the replay drawer before panning, so the newly spawned terminal is visible on the canvas instead of being hidden behind the drawer
- Left panel: the entire collapsed sidebar strip is now a click target — previously only the small chevron at the bottom expanded it
- Usage: overlay sizing tightened — individual components (stat cards, quota meters, device rows) no longer stretch beyond their readable width; the dashboard auto-hides when the canvas gap falls below a usable threshold and reappears when the side panels are narrowed again
- Usage: aligned chart heights and axis margins so side-by-side cards match; removed duplicate section titles; heatmap extended to a full year and centred within its card

### Changed
- Layout: the left and right panels swapped responsibilities. Files / Diff / Git / Memory tabs moved to the right panel (resizable, collapsible). The left panel is now dedicated to project management + history
- Sessions: replay view is now a left-anchored drawer that pulls out from the right edge of the left panel, with half / full expand levels. The old full-screen modal is gone — the session list lives in the left panel and stays visible while a replay plays

### Added (zh-CN)
- 编辑器:全画布 Monaco 抽屉 —— 在右侧栏 Files 里点任意文件,会像 VSCode 那样打开一个真正的编辑器,带语法高亮、Cmd+S 保存、脏状态跟踪、半屏/全屏切换。取代了之前拥挤的 preview tab
- 编辑器:自定义 Monaco 主题匹配 app 暖色调 —— 暗色用 charcoal `#1a1918`(不是 VSCode 原生的冷灰);亮色重做了整套语法色(warm violet 关键字、green 字符串、amber 数字、teal 类型),在 cream 背景上读起来自然,不会像原版 vs 那样饱和度过高显脏
- 左侧栏:项目管理 + 会话历史二合一。标题栏 + 折叠态都有「+」按钮,一键加项目;ProjectTree 下方是 History 区,列出当前 canvas 范围内的过往 Claude/Codex 会话
- Canvas-gap 抽屉体系:Usage 仪表盘、会话回放不再是全屏弹窗,而是锚定在左右栏之间的那块区域里,两边导航始终可见。Usage / 文件编辑器 / 会话回放三者在这块空间里互斥,同一时刻只显示一个

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 会话:Claude 的 Resume 按钮不再全灰 —— projectDir 现在从 Claude JSONL 里直接读真实 `cwd`,而不是用 dash 编码的目录名,worktree 匹配成功
- 会话:Codex Resume 终于真能续接了 —— sessionId 从 `session_meta.payload.id` 里取(这是 `codex resume` 接受的 id),不再用文件名 stem(Codex 拒收,然后 fallback 成全新会话)
- 会话:点 Resume 后会先关闭回放抽屉再 pan 到新 terminal,不会出现"新 terminal 生成但被抽屉挡住看不见"的情况
- 左侧栏:折叠态整条竖条都可点击展开 —— 之前只有底部那个小箭头能展开
- Usage:面板尺寸收紧 —— StatCard / Quota / Devices 不会再被撑到远超可读宽度;canvas gap 太窄时仪表盘自动消失,缩回左右栏后重新出现
- Usage:并排卡片高度和横轴 margin 统一对齐;去掉了重复的 section 标题;热力图扩展到整年并在卡片内水平居中

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 布局:左右栏职能对调。Files / Diff / Git / Memory 四个 tab 搬到右侧栏(可拖宽、可折叠),左侧栏专门负责项目管理 + 历史
- 会话:回放从全屏 modal 改成左锚定抽屉,从左栏右边缘划出,支持半屏/全屏两级。历史列表留在左栏持续可见,边看回放边切 session 不用关抽屉

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Terminal: new terminals stick to your preferred size — the first manual resize is learned and used for every subsequent "+ Terminal", regardless of sidebar width or collapse state
- Pet: refreshed capybara sprites with more expressive face, contour, and animation cadence
- Pet: ground shadow + heart/dust particle system for richer visual feedback
- Pet: richer idle behaviors including emotes, walk dust, bobbing question marks, and a spa-yuzu scene
- Pet: offline sprite preview script (`pet-preview`) for inspecting animations without running the app
- Telemetry: event-driven `awaiting_input` detection for Claude and Codex, replacing timer-based polling with signal-driven accuracy
- Hydra: PTY shell pid and capture time now persisted on each assignment run for post-hoc debugging
- Hydra: surfaces `stall_advisory` as a DecisionPoint to the Lead when a worker stops making progress

### Fixed
- Telemetry: first session attach now discards any `ps`-contaminated state left by previous unknown-provider detection
- Telemetry: derived state is reset when a terminal's provider flips from unknown to a known agent, preventing stale indicators
- Telemetry: MCP daemon churn no longer masquerades as agent progress or active tool calls
- Hydra: cleanup guarded against non-Lead callers to prevent orphaned workbench state
- Hydra: dispatch prompt strengthened; skill install failures now surface to the Lead instead of failing silently
- Hydra: watch loop probes PTY liveness directly rather than inferring it from polling cadence

### Changed
- Internal: every timing threshold centralized into `shared/lifecycleThresholds` so behavior adjustments don't require hunting through the codebase

### Added (zh-CN)
- 终端：新建终端会保持你的偏好尺寸——第一次手动调整大小后会被记住，后续每次「+ Terminal」都用这个尺寸，不再被侧边栏宽度或折叠状态影响

- 遥测：MCP 守护进程的抖动不再被误判为 agent 进度或工具调用
- Hydra：清理流程防护非 Lead 调用方，防止遗留 workbench 状态
- Hydra：加强分派 prompt；技能安装失败现在会暴露给 Lead，不再静默失败
- Hydra：watch 循环直接探测 PTY 活性，而非根据轮询节奏推断

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 内部：所有时间阈值集中到 `shared/lifecycleThresholds`，行为调整不用再满代码库找

## [0.28.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Pet: richer telemetry-driven reactions for tool running, tool pending, workflow start/completion/failure, stall, and stuck states

### Fixed
- Keyboard: Cmd/Ctrl+A now scopes "Select All" to the active context, selecting the focused input/editor or the focused terminal buffer instead of the wrong surface
- Pet: suppress repeated completion alerts after a finished terminal has already been seen

### Added (zh-CN)
- 桌宠：接入更丰富的遥测驱动反馈，覆盖工具运行、工具等待、工作流开始/完成/失败、停滞与卡住等状态

- 键盘：Cmd/Ctrl+A 的“全选”现在按当前焦点上下文生效，会优先选中当前输入框/编辑区，或当前聚焦终端的缓冲区，而不是错误作用到别的区域
- 桌宠：已查看过完成结果的终端不再重复弹出完成提醒

## [0.28.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Pet: attention queue with priority-based terminal notifications, plus attention movement that brings the capybara inside the target terminal instead of parking on the title bar

### Fixed

- UI: remove the focused terminal side glow and keep the focus state indicated by border only
- Pet: refine capybara sprite shading, contour, detail, and movement sizing to match the larger sprite scale

### Added (zh-CN)
- 桌宠：新增按优先级排队的终端提醒气泡；提醒时水豚会进入目标终端内部，而不是停在标题栏上

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 终端：修复概览模式（Cmd+E）交互，单击后可立即输入，双击终端任意区域即可放大，并抑制导航时误触发 xterm 文本选区
- UI：移除终端聚焦时两侧的光晕，仅保留边框作为聚焦指示
- 桌宠：优化水豚精灵图的阴影、轮廓、细节和移动尺寸，使其与放大后的 sprite 比例一致

## [0.28.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Git: comprehensive git panel with stash, amend, merge, rebase, tags, remotes, file diff, and hunk staging
- Search: experimental global search (Cmd+K)
- Pet: pixel-art capybara desktop pet (experimental)

### Fixed

## [0.27.7] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Updater: blockmap-based differential downloads for macOS — subsequent updates now download only changed blocks (~3-5 MB) instead of the full ZIP (~120 MB), with automatic fallback to full download on failure
- Hydra: `hydra spawn --role <name>` dispatches any role (not just dev) into an isolated terminal
- Hydra: `hydra scan` convenience command — spawns a janitor role for codebase entropy scanning
- Hydra: role-specific model and reasoning effort are forwarded from role definitions to spawned agents

### Fixed
- Updater: skip directly to the latest version instead of updating through every intermediate release
- Updater: preserve pending update when offline so users can still install an already-downloaded version
- Updater: download to a temp directory so a failed download does not destroy a previously valid pending update
- Canvas: main worktree is no longer dropped when project scanner syncs worktree list
- CI: macOS ZIPs are re-compressed with rezip-electron for efficient differential updates; latest-mac.yml hashes are recomputed after optimization

### Changed
- Hydra: CLI cleanup — consistent reset behavior, cleanup state preservation, SubAgent renamed to Run

### Added (zh-CN)
- 更新器：macOS 基于 blockmap 的差量下载 — 后续更新仅下载变化的块（约 3-5 MB），而非完整 ZIP（约 120 MB），失败时自动回退到全量下载
- Hydra：`hydra spawn --role <name>` 可将任意角色调度到独立终端
- Hydra：`hydra scan` 快捷命令 — 启动 janitor 角色进行代码库熵扫描
- Hydra：角色定义中的 model 和 reasoning effort 会传递给生成的 agent

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 更新器：直接跳到最新版本，不再逐版本更新
- 更新器：离线时保留已下载的待安装更新，用户仍可安装
- 更新器：下载到临时目录，下载失败不会破坏已有的待安装更新
- 画布：项目扫描器同步 worktree 列表时不再丢失主 worktree
- CI：macOS ZIP 使用 rezip-electron 重压缩以支持高效差量更新；优化后重新计算 latest-mac.yml 的哈希值

### Changed (zh-CN)
- Hydra：CLI 清理 — 统一 reset 行为、cleanup 状态保留、SubAgent 重命名为 Run

## [0.27.6] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Hydra: rename Workflow → Workbench, Node → Dispatch — Hydra is now Lead's persistent workbench for multi-role orchestration, not a predefined workflow
- Hydra: remove DAG dependency system (`depends_on`, auto-blocking, cascade reset, node promotion) — Lead sequences dispatches manually and passes context explicitly via `--context-ref`
- Hydra: merge Node + Assignment into Dispatch, eliminating redundant abstraction layers; each dispatch carries inline status
- Hydra: CLI flags renamed (`--workflow` → `--workbench`, `--node` → `--dispatch`)
- Hydra: result contract uses `workbench_id` instead of `workflow_id`
- Hydra: file layout changed from `.hydra/workflows/` to `.hydra/workbenches/`, `nodes/` to `dispatches/`

### Changed (zh-CN)
- Hydra: 重命名 Workflow → Workbench, Node → Dispatch — Hydra 现在是 Lead 的持久化工作台，而非预定义工作流
- Hydra: 移除 DAG 依赖系统（`depends_on`、自动阻塞、级联重置、节点提升）— Lead 手动排序调度，通过 `--context-ref` 显式传递上下文
- Hydra: 合并 Node + Assignment 为 Dispatch，消除冗余抽象层；每个 dispatch 内联状态
- Hydra: CLI 参数重命名（`--workflow` → `--workbench`、`--node` → `--dispatch`）
- Hydra: 结果契约使用 `workbench_id` 替代 `workflow_id`
- Hydra: 文件布局从 `.hydra/workflows/` 变更为 `.hydra/workbenches/`，`nodes/` 变更为 `dispatches/`

## [0.27.5] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Clicking a worktree label on the canvas now also focuses that worktree, so a follow-up `cmd+t` creates the new terminal inside the worktree you just clicked instead of whichever one happened to be focused before. The label click handler now pairs `panToWorktree` with `focusWorktreeInScene`, matching the convention already used by Hub and `cmd+]` / `cmd+[` worktree-level navigation. The LOD project-label fallback (extreme zoom-out) also focuses the first populated worktree, so click-then-`cmd+t` works at every scale

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 在画布上点击 worktree 标签时，现在会同时把键盘焦点切到该 worktree，这样紧接着按 `cmd+t` 新建的终端会落在你刚刚点击的 worktree 里，而不是上一次焦点所在的 worktree。label 的 click handler 现在会同时调 `panToWorktree` 和 `focusWorktreeInScene`，与 Hub 以及 `cmd+]` / `cmd+[` worktree 级导航的现有约定一致。极远缩放下点击 LOD 模式的项目级合并标签也会聚焦该项目的第一个有内容的 worktree，因此在任何缩放比例下"点了再 cmd+t"都能落到正确位置

## [0.27.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Screen-space worktree label layer: each worktree now shows a pixel-fixed `project / worktree` label anchored to its topmost terminal, scaled-driven so it fades in as you zoom out and collapses to `Project (N)` at extreme zoom-out; hovering any terminal lights up its worktree's label, hovering or clicking a label highlights it and pans the viewport to fit the worktree
- Top-left HUD pill that shows the focused `project / worktree` whenever you're zoomed in past 0.7, so the canvas itself answers "where am I" without forcing the right session panel open
- `wuu` is now a first-class terminal agent type
- `IconButton` and `ConfirmDialog` UI primitives, adopted across the right session panel
- Sessions panel auto-opens the first time a project is added so new users see their newly added project immediately

### Changed
- `cmd+d` is now the strict inverse of `cmd+t`: closing the focused terminal lands focus on the spatial-LEFT row sibling in the SAME worktree (mirroring `cmd+t`'s right-of-focused insertion), and only walks worktree → project → cross-project as fallbacks. Pressing `cmd+t` then `cmd+d` round-trips back to the original focused tile, and you can no longer be silently kicked out of the project you were working in
- The yellow project-name sticker in each terminal header is removed; the new label layer carries that information at a readable size at every zoom
- The Hub focus-level switcher is hidden for now while the underlying level cycling is reworked, since it overlapped the new HUD
- The cluster toolbar is hidden until its layout algorithm is reworked
- Right session panel: project/worktree removal is unified on the new `ConfirmDialog`, with two-step confirm and a `--force` fallback for non-empty worktree removal
- Right session panel: chevrons are semantic `<button>`s with focus-visible rings and proper tablist semantics; left-click on a worktree row toggles expand instead of being conflated with focus

### Fixed
- New terminals now have their tile size recomputed on every create, so the first tile in a fresh worktree always lands at the right dimensions instead of inheriting a stale measurement
- Codex session attach now uses the SessionStart hook for an exact match instead of guessing from polling order
- OpenAI streaming `tool_call` accumulator is realigned with the `openai-node` upstream so partial argument chunks are stitched in the correct order

### Added (zh-CN)
- 屏幕坐标系下的 worktree 标签层：每个 worktree 现在会在它最上方那个终端的上方显示一个 `项目 / worktree` 标签，字号是固定像素大小，跟随画布平移和缩放但本身不会变小；标签会随着缩远渐入显示，缩到极远时会自动合并成 `Project (N)`；hover 任何终端会点亮它所属 worktree 的标签，hover 或点击标签会高亮它并把视口平移到刚好包住该 worktree
- 当画布缩放 ≥ 0.7（你正在某个终端里打字时），左上角会出现一个 HUD pill 显示当前焦点的 `项目 / worktree`，让画布本身回答"我在哪"，不再强迫你打开右侧 session 面板才知道
- `wuu` 现在是一等的终端 agent 类型
- 新增 `IconButton` 和 `ConfirmDialog` 两个 UI 原语，并在右侧 session 面板里推广使用
- 第一次新增项目时，session 面板会自动打开，让新用户立即看到刚添加的项目

### Changed (zh-CN)
- `cmd+d` 现在是 `cmd+t` 的严格逆运算：关闭焦点终端后，焦点会落到**同一个 worktree 内、同一行的左侧邻居**（对应 `cmd+t` 在焦点右边插入新终端），fallback 顺序严格走 worktree → project → 跨项目。连按 `cmd+t`、`cmd+d` 会完全回到原焦点终端；再也不会在你不知情的情况下被踢到别的项目里
- 删除了终端 header 上的黄色项目名贴纸；新的标签层在任何缩放下都能读清楚归属，贴纸不再需要
- Hub 层级切换器临时隐藏，因为和新 HUD 重叠，且底层 focus-level 还在改造
- 集群工具条临时隐藏，等布局算法重做完再恢复
- 右侧 session 面板：项目和 worktree 的删除流程统一到新的 `ConfirmDialog`，提供两步确认；非空 worktree 删除会回退到 `--force`
- 右侧 session 面板：折叠箭头改为语义 `<button>`，带 focus-visible 圈和正确的 tablist 语义；worktree 行的左键点击改为切换展开而不是混淆成 focus

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 新建终端现在每次都会重新计算 tile 尺寸，避免在一个空 worktree 里第一个终端继承到上次的旧尺寸
- Codex 会话 attach 改为通过 SessionStart hook 精确匹配，不再依赖轮询顺序猜测
- OpenAI 流式 `tool_call` 累加器与上游 `openai-node` 对齐，部分参数 chunk 现在按正确顺序拼接

## [0.27.3] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- Dragging the left sidebar width no longer force-zooms the focused terminal back to fit-scale when the canvas is in plain (non zoom-focus) focus mode; the resize cleanup now consults the shared viewport focus state and only re-fits the viewport when the user is actually in zoom-focus mode

### Changed
- The "zoomed out vs zoom-focused" flag previously kept as a local ref inside the keyboard shortcut hook is now lifted into a shared `viewportFocusStore`, so any surface that mutates the viewport (sidebar resize today, future panels tomorrow) reads the same source of truth instead of guessing the mode

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 在“仅聚焦”（非放大聚焦）模式下拖动左侧栏宽度，不再强制把当前聚焦终端重新放大充满视口；拖动结束后的清理逻辑会读取共享的视口聚焦状态，只有在真正处于放大聚焦模式时才会重新 fit 视口

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 原本只活在键盘快捷键 hook 里的 `zoomedOutTerminalIdRef` 已提升为共享的 `viewportFocusStore`，让所有会改动视口的入口（当前是侧栏拖动，未来其它面板）都从同一份状态读取焦点模式，而不是各自猜测

## [0.27.2] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Terminal tiles can now use the first real user prompt from telemetry as the default title, so new Codex/agent sessions are easier to distinguish in the canvas and sessions panel

### Fixed
- Telemetry title extraction now skips injected context so agent terminals do not pick a synthetic bootstrap message as the visible title
- Sessions wait one poll cycle before accepting Codex session data and reject the baseline session, reducing false-positive terminal matches during initial discovery
- Terminal resize handles now appear on hover instead of only on selected tiles, making free-resize discoverable without bringing back the always-on frame
- Cmd+T placement now anchors from the focused terminal when possible, keeping new terminals closer to the user’s current working area

### Added (zh-CN)
- 终端瓦片现在可以把遥测中的第一条真实用户消息作为默认标题，因此新的 Codex/agent 会话在画布和会话面板里更容易区分

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 遥测标题提取现在会跳过注入的上下文，避免 agent 终端把启动时的合成引导消息显示成可见标题
- 会话发现现在会先延后一轮轮询再接受 Codex 会话数据，并过滤基线会话，减少初始化阶段的误匹配
- 终端尺寸调节手柄改为 hover 时显示，而不是只在选中 tile 时显示，让自由调整尺寸更容易被发现，同时不再恢复常驻外框
- Cmd+T 放置新终端时会优先以当前聚焦终端为锚点，让新 terminal 更接近用户当前的工作区域

## [0.27.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Terminal resize handles and the surrounding node outline no longer stay visible on every tile all the time; the resizer now appears only for the selected terminal, removing the always-on blue frame from the canvas
- Closing a terminal with cmd+d now re-zooms to the next focused terminal when the canvas is in normal zoomed-in navigation mode, instead of only panning and leaving the viewport scale behind

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 终端尺寸调节手柄和外围节点描边不再常驻显示在每个 tile 外侧；现在只有选中该终端时才显示，去掉了画布上一直存在的蓝色外框
- 在普通聚焦导航模式下，用 cmd+d 关闭终端后，现在会重新缩放聚焦到下一个终端，而不是只平移视口导致缩放状态残留

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Free resize of terminal tiles: drag any corner or edge of a terminal node to reshape it live; the inner xterm refits cols/rows on release
- Double-click the terminal header to zoom-to-fit that terminal (restored after the flat-canvas refactor, now respects the tile's current freely-resized dimensions)
- Clicking a worktree or project row in the session panel activates it, so a subsequent cmd+t targets that row without having to click back on the canvas first
- Right-clicking a session panel row also activates it before opening the context menu so cmd+t after dismissing the menu still lands on the right row
- Viewport-aware grid placement for cmd+t: new terminals now fill the visible canvas row-major (top-left → bottom-right), stepping past user-resized wide tiles instead of getting stuck behind them; the old rightmost-sibling anchor is kept as a fallback only when the viewport is saturated or smaller than a default tile
- Spatial (y asc, x asc, id) navigation order shared between cmd+] / cmd+[ and cmd+d's "next focus after close", so prev/next and post-close focus both follow what the user sees on screen instead of the array insertion order that only made sense on the old grid layout

### Changed
- cmd+t no longer stacks new terminals vertically below the worktree's bounding box; the no-parent placement path anchors off the rightmost sibling first (when the viewport grid is unavailable) instead of its bottom
- Session panel row click only activates the row; collapse/expand is now a dedicated chevron button so the two gestures don't stomp on each other

### Fixed
- cmd+d lands focus on the spatial next terminal to match cmd+] / cmd+[, instead of whichever terminal happened to be array-adjacent inside the same worktree
- Restored CLI tiles fall back to a default shell when the original CLI process is already gone during session rehydration, instead of leaving a dead tile behind

### Removed
- cmd+1 / cmd+2 / cmd+3 / cmd+4 tile-size presets (tileSizeDefault / tileSizeWide / tileSizeTall / tileSizeLarge): the hardcoded 640x480 / 1288x480 / 640x968 / 1288x968 dimensions ignored the adaptive tileDimensionsStore and interacted badly with focus zoom. Free NodeResizer drag-resize replaces them end-to-end. Removed shortcut definitions on both mac and win/linux defaults, the handler loop, the SettingsModal / ShortcutHints rows, the en/zh i18n strings, and the now-unused updateTerminalSizeInScene action. The localStorage migration helper strips any leftover span* / tileSize* keys on load

### Added (zh-CN)
- 终端瓦片支持鼠标自由调整尺寸：拖动节点四角或四边即时改变大小,释放后 xterm cols/rows 自动重新适配
- 双击终端顶部标题栏聚焦放大该终端（在自由画布重构之后补回,现在会按照 tile 当前的自由尺寸计算缩放）
- 在右侧会话面板点击某个 worktree 或 project 行会把它激活,接着按 cmd+t 就会在对应行下建新终端,不用再切回 canvas 点一下
- 右键会话面板的行时也会先激活所在行再弹出菜单,避免关闭菜单后 cmd+t 还落到之前那一行
- cmd+t 的新终端放置改为感知视口的行优先网格填充（左上 → 右下）：遇到用户自由 resize 出来的宽胖 tile 会跳过它继续在同一行放置,视口塞满或太小时才回退到 rightmost-sibling 锚点
- cmd+] / cmd+[ 和 cmd+d 关闭后的"下一个焦点"统一改成空间顺序（按 y 升序再按 x 升序,同位置用 id 做稳定 tiebreaker）,和屏幕上看到的前后关系一致,不再跟随数组创建顺序

### Changed (zh-CN)
- cmd+t 不再把新终端堆到 worktree 包围盒下方;没有 parent 的情况在视口网格不可用时会锚到 rightmost sibling 的右边,而不是底部
- 会话面板的行点击只触发激活,折叠/展开归还给独立的 chevron 图标,两个动作不再互相干扰

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- cmd+d 关闭焦点终端后的新焦点改为空间顺序上的下一个,和 cmd+] / cmd+[ 的语义对齐,不再跳到数组里的创建顺序邻居
- 恢复会话时如果原来的 CLI 进程已经退出,现在会自动落回一个默认 shell,而不是留下一个死 tile

### Removed (zh-CN)
- 删除 cmd+1/2/3/4 的 tile-size 预设快捷键（tileSizeDefault / tileSizeWide / tileSizeTall / tileSizeLarge）：硬编码的 640x480 / 1288x480 / 640x968 / 1288x968 完全忽略自适应的 tileDimensionsStore,并且和聚焦缩放有互相干扰。自由拖拽节点手柄调整尺寸已经完整替代这套快捷键。相关的 mac 和 win/linux 键位定义、handler 循环、SettingsModal / ShortcutHints 显示行、en/zh i18n 字符串、以及无人引用的 updateTerminalSizeInScene action 全部一并删除;localStorage 里遗留的 span* / tileSize* 键会在加载时自动清理

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Free canvas layout: terminals are now flat top-level ReactFlow nodes that can be freely positioned, replacing the nested project/worktree containers
- Clustering toolbar with rule picker (by project / worktree / type / status / custom tag) and an undo for the last cluster
- Custom Tags… popover on each terminal for managing user tags
- Auto-placement for newly created terminals so they land in a free spot on the canvas
- Collision resolver to nudge tiles apart when they overlap (also applied when unstashing)
- Add Project Folder entry in the canvas right-click menu and a + button in the session panel header
- Inline + button on session panel rows for creating a new terminal in that project/worktree
- Hover × button to remove a non-main worktree directly from the session panel
- Hover × button to close a single terminal directly from its session panel card
- Remove Project entry in the project context menu (panel-only removal, files untouched)
- Delete Project from Disk… entry with a typed-name confirmation modal that calls a guarded `project:delete-folder` IPC
- Auto-migration from legacy v1 (nested) snapshots into the free canvas layout on load
- End-to-end integration test suite for the free canvas

### Changed
- Session panel strings (context menus, notifications, delete-project modal) are fully internationalized; added panel_* keys to en/zh dictionaries
- Worktree row now exposes Remove via the hover × button instead of a right-click menu
- Canvas right-click menu uses the shared ContextMenu component for consistency
- Shortcut identifiers renamed from span* to tileSize* (existing keybinds preserved)

### Fixed
- Popovers (canvas right-click menu, cluster dropdown) no longer stay stuck open: dismiss listeners now run in the capture phase so React Flow's stopPropagation can't swallow them
- Cluster toolbar now positions itself below the toolbar and respects the right-panel inset
- Terminal tile border restored after the free-canvas flatten refactor
- Session panel now shows projects and worktrees that have no terminals
- Cluster toolbar gained Escape-to-close support

### Removed
- Dead grid-pack helpers superseded by the free canvas layout
- Orphaned compactFocusedProject shortcut

### Added (zh-CN)

- 会话面板的终端卡片支持 hover 时显示 × 按钮直接关闭终端
- 项目右键菜单新增 "Remove Project"（仅从面板移除，磁盘文件不动）
- 项目右键菜单新增 "Delete Project from Disk…"，需在弹窗中输入项目名确认，主进程 `project:delete-folder` IPC 已加路径安全护栏
- 加载旧版 v1（嵌套）快照时自动迁移到自由画布布局
- 自由画布的端到端集成测试套件

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 会话面板的所有文案（右键菜单、通知、删除项目弹窗等）已完成国际化，新增 panel_* 键到 en/zh 字典
- Worktree 移除入口从右键菜单改为 hover 时的 × 按钮
- 画布右键菜单改为复用共享的 ContextMenu 组件
- 快捷键标识符从 span* 重命名为 tileSize*（已有键位保持不变）

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 画布右键菜单和集群下拉菜单不再卡住打不掉：dismiss 监听器改在 capture 阶段触发，避免被 React Flow 的 stopPropagation 吞掉
- 集群工具栏现在放在工具栏下方，并尊重右侧面板的内边距
- 修复自由画布扁平化重构后丢失的终端瓦片边框
- 会话面板现在会显示没有终端的项目和工作树
- 集群工具栏新增 Escape 关闭

### Removed (zh-CN)
- 删除自由画布之后已无用的 grid-pack 辅助代码
- 删除已无引用的 compactFocusedProject 快捷键

## [0.25.23] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Separated terminal focus semantics from viewport zoom semantics:
  - Clicking a terminal now keeps focus highlight without forcing viewport zoom.
  - Cmd+E now toggles zoom state while keeping terminal focus highlight.
- Cmd+T and Cmd+D now preserve current zoom scale and only pan the viewport.
- In non-zoomed mode, Cmd+[ and Cmd+] now preserve scale and only pan to the previous/next focused terminal.

### Changed (zh-CN)
- 终端聚焦语义与视口缩放语义已拆分：
  - 点击终端仅保留聚焦高亮，不再强制缩放视口。
  - Cmd+E 改为切换缩放状态，同时保留终端聚焦高亮。
- Cmd+T 与 Cmd+D 现在保持当前缩放比例，仅平移视口。
- 在非放大模式下，Cmd+[ 与 Cmd+] 现在保持缩放比例，仅平移到上一个/下一个聚焦终端。

## [0.25.22] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Sessions panel terminal ordering is now stable within project/worktree groups instead of dynamically reordering by activity updates

### Fixed (zh-CN)
- 会话面板在项目/工作树分组内的终端顺序改为稳定顺序，不再随活动更新动态重排

## [0.25.21] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Worktree management now supports create/remove routes in the Electron API server and IPC bridge
- Added right-click "New Worktree..." and "Remove Worktree" menus in the sessions project tree and canvas project/worktree headers

### Added (zh-CN)
- Electron API server 与 IPC bridge 新增工作树创建/删除能力
